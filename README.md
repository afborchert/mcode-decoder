# M-Code decoder

This is mcd, an M-Code decoder which disassembles the code of the Lilith
architecture.

Please be aware that this code was developed for temporary use only
in July / August 1983. It depends on a K&R compiler. This was developed and
run on a Perkin-Elmer 3220 architecture running Unix Edition VII. It
is recommended to compile and run this on an emulator of the ancient
architecture this utility was developed on.
